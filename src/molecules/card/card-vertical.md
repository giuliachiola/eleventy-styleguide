# Card Vertical 

# Usage
Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.

They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Anatomy 
The card container is the only required element in a card. All other elements shown here are optional.

Card layouts can vary to support the types of content they contain. The following elements are commonly found among that variety.


## Gestures
Gestures should be implemented consistently within a card collection. Frequently used gestures on cards include swipe, pick up and move, and scrolling.

### Swipe
A swipe gesture can be performed on a single card at a time, anywhere on that card.

It can be used to:
- Dismiss a card
- Change the state of a card (such as flagging or archiving it)

### Pick up and move
The pick up and move gesture allows users to move and re-order cards in a collection.
